## Purpose

We human beings can do 3D reconstruction from single image. Instead of depth estimation from image, we humans beings seems to use a different way, which is to call 3D model in mind, re-align these 3D models and change hyper-parameters of 3D models in the virtual world of our brain. Therefore, why not try to find a way to realign 3D models by single image instead of directly estimating depth. 



In this work, we try to find a **way to re-align 3D models in 3D space guided by the single images**.  There are two steps needs to be done, as follows:

- Image-guided 3D Re-Alignment: object detection, 3D model matching, and 3D model pose estimation.
- Image-guided 3D Hyper-parameter of variants model estimation.
