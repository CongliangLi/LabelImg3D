# KITTI
We propose a dataset, named "kitti-img3D", which is based on the kitti 3D object detection dataset.

## Model List
We use the following models

| Model Name | Class Name | Class Index | Model Size (LxWxH) | Model Demo|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| tram_001.obj| Tram | 1 | $15.21\times 2.37 \times 3.62$   | ![](../images/../imgs/kitti_tram.gif) |
| car_001.obj| Car | 2 | $3.84\times 1.64 \times 1.50$   | ![](../images/../imgs/kitti_car.gif) |
| truck_001.obj| Truck | 3 | $5.8\times 2.63 \times 2.85$   | ![](../images/../imgs/kitti_truck.gif) |
| van_001.obj| Van | 4 |  $4.62\times 1.88 \times 2.06$  | ![](../images/../imgs/kitti_van.gif) |
| pedestrian_001.obj| Pedestrian | 5 | $0.91 \times 0.66 \times 1.76$ |     |
