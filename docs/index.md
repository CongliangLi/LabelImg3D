# Welcome to LabelImg3D

The image-guided 3D reconstruction of traffic scenes is crucial for self-driving, and traffic event detection. We propose a first-of-its-kind labeling tool (named LabelImg3D) that can reconstruct the vehicular distribution by simply providing inputs of 3D vehicle/pedestrian models and images. 

LabelImg3D is an annotation tools for labeling the 3D model in the image, in order to get the extrinsic parameters between the camera and the 3D model.
